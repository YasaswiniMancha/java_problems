Constructor chaining in Java refers to the process of calling one constructor from another constructor within the same class or a parent class. There are two types of constructor chaining:

1. Within the Same Class (this()):
A constructor in a class can call another constructor of the same class using the this() keyword.
This is used to reuse constructor logic within the same class and avoid code duplication.

2. Between Parent and Child Class (super()):
A constructor in a subclass can call a constructor of the parent class using the super() keyword.
This is used to initialize the parent class's state when creating an instance of the child class.


this() must be the first statement in a constructor when used.
super() must also be the first statement when used in a subclass constructor.
Both cannot be used together in the same constructor, as they must be the first statement.
