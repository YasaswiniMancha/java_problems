static keyword is used for memory management and 
to define members (fields and methods) that belong to the class rather than any specific instance of the class.


Uses of static in Java: 

1. static variables: A static variable is shared among all instances of a class. It belongs to the class, not to any individual object.
2. static methods: A static method belongs to the class and can be called without creating an object. Static methods:
                   Can access static variables directly.
                   Cannot directly access non-static variables or methods (require an object reference).
3. static blocks: Static blocks are used to initialize static variables or execute code that needs to run once when the class is loaded.
4. static inner classes: Static nested classes can be instantiated without an instance of the outer class.


1. What is a static keyword in Java?

Static is a Non-Access Modifier. Static can be applied to variable, method, nested class,  and initialization blocks (static block).


2. Why main() method is declared as static?

If our main() method is not declared as static then the JVM has to create an object first and call which causes the problem of having extra memory allocation.


3. Can constructors be static in Java?

In general, a static method means that “The Method belongs to the class and not to any particular object” but a constructor is always invoked with respect to an object, so it makes no sense for a constructor to be static.

 
4. Can we use this to refer static members?

 Yes, it's possible to access the static variables of a class using this but it's discouraged and as per best practices this should be used on nonstatic reference.

 
5. What are all the differences between this and the super keyword?

This refers to the current class object whereas super refers to the superclass object
Using this we can access all non-static methods and variables. Using super we can access superclass variables and methods from sub-class.
Using this(); call we can call other constructors in the same class. Using super we can call superclass constructor from sub-class constructor.
 

6. What is a final method?

When a method is declared as final, then it is called a final method, The subclass can call the final method of the parent class but cannot override it.

 

7. Can a main() method be declared final?

Yes, the main() method can be declared as final and cannot be overridden.

 

8. What is a Static Final variable in Java?

When have declared a variable as static final then the variable becomes a CONSTANT.  Only one copy of the variable exists which cannot be changed by any instance.


9. Which is the parent class of all the Exception classes?

Throwable Class

10. How many operand can unary operators take in java?

only 1

11. What is the output of the following Java code?

public class Test {

    int x = 10;
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.print(x);
    }

    static {
        System.out.println(x + 10);
    }

}

error

If we are trying to print the instance variable inside the static block or static method without creating the class instance then
 it will give a compile-time error. non static variable x cannot be referenced from a static context.
